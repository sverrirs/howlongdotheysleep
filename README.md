# How long do they sleep
Do all animals sleep? When does a dolphin have a chance to take a nap? Does a horse need to lie down to get some shut-eye? Do opossums and bats really sleep upside-down? Here are some fun facts about animalsâ€™ sleeping habits that may surprise you! These are the top weird animal facts about sleeping, for those who are curious about the dreams of the animal kingdom.

I though it would be interesting to create an interactive and dynamic version of the excellent [infographic](http://sleepopolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sleep-Habits-of-the-Animal-Kingdom.jpg) produced by Sleepopolis.

See the interactive version at:

For editing purposes I have set up a Codepen version at
